This is a fork of the newly-rebased-and-officially-released lineage-18.1 branch from LineageOS, with some extra goodies added in like clang-12 support, wireguard support, battery-idle-mode-enabled charging switch, and OOS Q source additions to support DC dimming (LOS Anti Flicker).

Milestone 07 is a snapshot of the May 2021 crDroid v7.6 release.
