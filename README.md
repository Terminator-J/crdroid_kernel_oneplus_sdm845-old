## Hola amiguitos

Milestone 04 was the February 2021 release. Based on the existing crDroid 10 kernel with some bits added trying to get DC Dimming and a few other things working. Dead end, as we're switching to Illusion kernel for now, until such time as the LineageOS devs come back to working on SDM845 and re-adding missing pieces from the OOS Q drop so that nodes exist for DeviceSettings to hook into.
