## Hola amiguitos

This is my attempt to fix up and add a little crDroid customization flavor back into the sdm845 kernel tree for OnePlus 6 & 6T (enchilada & fajita).

Rebased on the official lineage-18.1 branch from LineageOS as of September 2021, with some extra goodies added in like clang-12 support, multiple vibration type support, wireguard support, and battery-idle-mode-enabled charging switches.

Reworked the DC Dimming (among other things) commit substantially, and everything seems to work. Like, shockingly well. This is amazing. If only it worked with video recording/cameras more nicely, this would be a phenomenal kernel to stick with.
